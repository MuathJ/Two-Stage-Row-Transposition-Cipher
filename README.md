# Two Stage Row Transposition Cipher


1. Write a computer program that reads a text file containing a plaintext as input and then encrypts this text using Two-stage Row transposition cipher. The ciphertext should be written to an output file. The key should be user-defined in your program.

2. Write a computer program that reads ciphertext generated from your program in (1) and decrypts the ciphertext to obtain the original plaintext.

3. Analyse the algorithm through plotting the runtime of the encryption/decryption versus the input file size, and state your conclusions.
